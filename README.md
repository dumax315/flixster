### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in our labs were a good starting point for the project. Specificly the discussion of useState proved very useful.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

I would have integrated with the "themoviedb.org" auth system and allowed users to leave review on movies. I would have also spent time on a feature to find movies near you.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

n/a did not demo this week.

### Open-source libraries used

- Font Awesome
- telefunc (but only in the adding-cloud-functions branch)
